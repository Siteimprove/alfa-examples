# Component framework testing

This directory demonstrates how Alfa can be used to test:

- [Angular components](angular);
- [React components](react);
- [Vue components](vue).

Note that each example is only running one rule, [SIA-R12](https://alfa.siteimprove.com/rules/sia-r12), which applies to buttons, given that the component tested is a button.

The Angular test currently do not work, not sure exactly what the problem is.
