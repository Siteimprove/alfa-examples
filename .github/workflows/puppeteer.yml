name: Puppeteer tests

# We've experienced quite a lot of instability with the puppeteer setup, notably
# the fact that it works locally but not in the Github action. Thus, we've removed
# it from the main integrate workflow, which in turns means we do not have a nice
# way to try and fix it.

# This workflow only runs the puppeteer tests, and MUST NOT be required as a branch
# protection. It will nonetheless let us monitor the status of it and make it easier
# for us to fix the problems once we get to it.
