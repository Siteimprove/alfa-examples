This directory demonstrates how Alfa can be used for some common testing cases:

- Gathering data:
  - [Scraping](scraping) and auditing a single page.
  - [Crawling](crawling) a site and auditing all its pages.
- Playing with the page:
  - [Interacting](interacting) with a know page (filling form, clicking button, â€¦) and auditing it afterwards.
- Changing the ruleset:
  - [Selecting rules](selecting) by conformance level, WCAG version, or scope (testing components in isolation).
  - [Adding a new rule](adding-rules) to the default ruleset.
