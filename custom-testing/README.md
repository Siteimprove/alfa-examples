  - [Crawling](crawling) a site and auditing all its pages.
  - [Answering](answering) the questions asked by Alfa to fully audit a page.
- Playing with the page:
  - [Interacting](interacting) with a know page (filling form, clicking button, â€¦) and auditing it afterwards.
  - [Navigating](navigating) to another page (e.g. testing pages in a checkout flow).
- Changing the ruleset:
