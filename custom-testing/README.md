# Custom testing

This directory demonstrates how Alfa can be used for some common testing cases:

- Gathering data:
  - [Scraping](scraping) and auditing a single page.
  - [Crawling](crawling) a site and auditing all its pages.
  - [Answering](answering) the questions asked by Alfa to fully audit a page.
- Playing with the page:
  - [Interacting](interacting) with a know page (filling form, clicking button, …) and auditing it afterwards.
  - [Navigating](navigating) to another page (e.g. testing pages in a checkout flow).
- Changing the ruleset:
  - [Selecting rules](filtering) by conformance level, WCAG version, or scope (testing components in isolation).
  - [Adding a new rule](adding-rules) to the default ruleset.
