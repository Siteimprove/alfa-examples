/**
 * Building an Oracle for the question "background-colors" on text within
 * an element with class "hello".
 *
 * The URI of the question is linked to the expected type of answer (here,
 * Iterable<Color>). So passing in the wrong kind of answer result in a type
 * error at build time.
 *
 * Here, the oracle is wrapped in a function that adds a parameter to tweak the
 * answer; this is just to demonstrate what happens when cantTell outcomes
 * resolve to Failed (see the test below).
 *
 * Such a parameter can also be used to inject answers to all questions, see
 * https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa/blob/main/packages/alfa-rules/test/common/oracle.ts
 * for a more complete Oracle building (although it does only check the URI
 * of the question (not its subject), and therefore isn't well suited on larger
 * tests where the same question might be asked with different subjects).
