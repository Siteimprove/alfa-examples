# Answering questions

Usage:

```shell
yarn test
```

The [page in the fixtures](fixtures/page.html) will be tested. An oracle is built to answer the question about color background, hence the audit has no `cantTell` results.

The full outcome of the audit is saved in the [`outcomes`](outcomes) directory.
